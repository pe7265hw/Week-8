Property ... was accessed during render but is not defined on instance.

This means that the variable you are attempting to use in the Vue managed code has not been defined or returned
in the createApp/setup section of the code. You are not able to ignore this because as far as the code
is concerned, the variable does not exist or has not be instantiated.
